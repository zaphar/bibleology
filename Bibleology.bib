@book{calculus-college-textbook,
	Abstract = {This Sixth Edition preserves the strengths that characterize the entire Swokowski series of Mathematical texts--mathematical integrity, comprehensive discussions of the concepts of calculus, and an impressively large collection of worked examples and illustrative figures. The text is written for the standard three-semester calculus course and allows instructors maximum flexibility in designing their courses. This edition incorporates a number of new elements including sections on: exponentials and logarithms, the analytic geometry of conic sections, mathematical models in economics and the life and social sciences, numerical integration, and numerical methods for solving differential equations.

Applied problems from physics, chemistry, biology, economics, physiology, sociology, psychology, ecology, oceanography, meteorology, radiotherapy, astronautics, and transportation are included. The applications in this edition range from the population of an endangered species to the spread of the AIDS virus, to computer-aided design, to the breakdown of pesticides.},
